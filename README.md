# Number-Guesser
### A simple, yet difficult for beginners, app that asks the user to guess a random number.

## Installation Steps

### Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/ericfitzsimons451/Number-Guesser.git```

### Open index.html in your preferred browser

## Background/About

### This was my first Javascript project as a student at Turing School of Software and Design.  Having never written computer code prior to preparing for Turing, it was interesting to dive into how Javascript logic works.  Adapting my thought process to break down tasks into incremental steps while also learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript provided a new and unique challenge.  

## Future Iterations

- Create custom range for guessing
- Increase the range when a correct guess is given
- Implement a timer and/or guess counter
- Create high-scores page
